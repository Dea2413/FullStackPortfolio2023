                        Foxes are great night-time predators. 
                        <p style = "font-weight: lighter; font-size: large;">
                            They have amazing eyes that allow them to see in the dark. There is a layer behind the light sensitive cells, which doubles the intensity of the light they percive. ultimately allowing them to see in the dark, and hunt their prey.

                        Foxes are considered to be solitary animals. 
                        <p style = "font-weight: lighter; font-size: large;">
                            They are not pack animals. At most they would be a mother and her cubs, a pack refered to commonly as a 'skulk'.

                        Foxes can make over 40 different sounds.
                        <p style = "font-weight: lighter; font-size: large;">
                            The sound a fox makes can vary from a scream to a bark to a howl. Foxes can make a varaition of sounds in order to communicate diffrent things as they each have a parrticular meaning.

                    <li>
                        Foxes make use of the earth's magnetic field to hunt. 
                        <p style = "font-weight: lighter; font-size: large;">
                            Foxes have the ability to sense the earth's magnetic feild and using this they can judge distances and direction of their prey. An espeically useful skill when your prey tends to hide in tall grasses.

                    <li>
                        People used to fear foxes but they are actually considered friendly animals. 
                        <p style = "font-weight: lighter; font-size: large;">
                            There really is no reason to fear such cute creatures. Most fox species are knonw to be freindly, curious and playful with other animals and foxes, humans included. These mischief makers are known to steal balls from gold courses and gardens.

                        Foxes only reproduce once a year. 
                        <p style = "font-weight: lighter; font-size: large;">
                            There is only one mating season a year for foxes. Usually in January in early February, with a pregnancy lasting about 60 days. Vixens usually give birth to four to six cubs.

                        Baby foxes are unable to see, walk or thermoregulate when they are born. 
                        <p style = "font-weight: lighter; font-size: large;">
                            Cubs do not leave the den until about 3 weeks after birth when that are able to articulate their surroundings. Till then they remain home with their mother while the male fox venture out for food.

                        <p style = "font-weight: lighter; font-size: large;">
                            Foxes are not only known to live deep in mythical forests but also in urban structures. Urban foxes tend to make thier homes underneath garden sheds, bushes or maybe even in tree roots.

                            As the expert hunter they are, foxes have a very varied diet. With a diet not only including rabbits, rodents, and birds, but also berries and fruits. Foxes can be classified as omnivores.

                            To aid in being excellent hunters, foxes possess excellent hearing. They have the ability to hear various low frequencies, that ultimately allow them to hear a rodent digging underground meters away.
